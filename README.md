# Installation 

The JavaApp is configured to run on any agent containing the text Jmx ( e.g JmxIndexer ). To change the name of an Indexer update the boot.properties file in the $LOGSCAPE\_HOME folder. 
Update the following property to change the name of your Indexer.

	 -Dvso.resource.type=Indexer  ( could also be IndexStore or Forwarder ) 

If you want to run the JavaApp on the Manager update your overrides properties file.  See [below](https://github.com/logscape/javaapp#agent-type) for details 

## Log4J 

 Create a datasource for each applicaiton you would like to monitor. Naming datasources according to application and environment to help in organising your searches. For example, a system administrator may be in charge of tomcat servers in DEV,UAT and PROD environments; he may choose his datasources

	tomcat-dev
	tomcat-uat
	tomcat-prod

## Garbage Collection logging

Update your java application's JAVAOPTS to switch on GC Logging. 

	-Xloggc:app0gc.log -XX:+UseGCLogFileRotation  -XX:GCLogFileSize=100M 
	-XX:NumberOfGCLogFiles=1000 -XX:GCLogFileSize=1M
	 -verbose:gc  -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps -XX:+PrintGCDateStamps

Use the following filename for your gc logs

	{application}-{label}-gc.log

A few examples:

	logscape-qaenv-gc.log
	tomcat-uat-gc.log
	tradeserver-ratesprod-gc.log 


Create a datasource for your gc logs e.g 

	tomcat-gc 


## JMX Monitoring 

Configure your environment using the application override file. It is required for the JMX  statistics. 
Here's an example application override monitoring 3 Logscape agents. 

	*.group0.host=10.28.1.160,10.28.1.150,10.28.1.155
	*.group0.ports8989
	*.grouo0.label=logscape

The above configuration will connect to each host on port 8989 and collect JMX data. The jmx data from this host will contain a label 'logscape'. The label is used to describe a group of similar applictions. In this case they happen to be Logscape Indexers. My next group of applications are all tomcat servers. 

	*.group1.host=10.28.1.170,10.28.1.171
	*.group1.ports=9010
	*.group1.label=tomcat

You can define as many groups as you like in the overrides file. Once you have finished configuring your environment you can upload the file on the DEPLOY page. There is no need to click DEPLOY since it is not an App 


## Agent Type

The JavaApp by default will run on any Indexer named JmxIndexer or any agent that contains the text 'Jmx' . The following names are examples that fit this pattern

 * JmxIndexer
 * DevJmxIndexer
 * UatJmxIndexer 
 * PRODJmxIndexer 

You can override this by adding the following line to your overrides properties file

	bundle.defaults.resourceSelection=type contains XXX

XXX can be the name of the agent you want it to run on.

	bundle.defaults.resourceSelection=type contains TradeServerIndexer 

if you want to match a group of agents you can do something like the following


	bundle.defaults.resourceSelection=type contains  DS0
	
This example will run the JavaApp only on the following agents. 

	DS0Indexer
	UKDC0IndexStore
	EUDC1IndexStore
	JPDC1IndexStore


An example which runs the JavaApp on the Manager 


	bundle.defaults.resourceSelection=type contains Management
